# Information Architecture

## Submission Point Two

SP2 is a collection of documents resulting from the web development processes undertaken during week 2. 

Formative feedback on these documents will be provided during your weekly meeting with the tutors, enabling you to make amendments before final submission.

The following documents should be presented:

- [Personas](#Personas)
- [Site Plan](#site-plan)

---

## Personas

User Personas - Create 3 user personas based on the user types your research indicates you might expect to use your guide.

**One must be an international visitor to your site**. Maybe you could also include a disabled visitor but this must be based on your research, not a guess.

We prefer you to be creative and develop your own personas over using a template site. If you use a template make sure you customise the output.

### Instructions:

- Output each of your personas as .jpg or .png files
- Ensure the files are at least 1000px wide
- Save to the sp2-media folder
- Embed each persona image (using the code provided) in `personas.md`

> Document: [personas.md](personas.md)

## Site Plan

A site plan is an 2D illustration of your recommended architecture for the new site based on the findings of your card sorting and tree testing exercise.

You should use the format illustrated in class created in PowerPoint, use a flow chart tool like Visio, or draw with an illustration tool.

> You site plan is going to evolve over the project via a number of iterations, especially as you develop the content. Do not stray too far from the original results of your card test/tree test without testing again.

### Instructions:

- Output each of your site plan(s) as .jpg or .png files
- Ensure the files are at least 1000px wide
- Save to the sp2-media folder
- Embed each site plan using the code provided in `siteplan.md`
- add commentary as directed.

> Document: [siteplan.md](siteplan.md)

_Your initial site plan will be reviewed and feedback provided at SP2. As the project develops you can add any further iterations. They are all marked at SP5._

## User Storyboards

> STORYBOARDING, a technique used in the film-making industry, is a way of conveying a story to teams and stakeholders, as well as a way to explore the best way to tell the story visually before spending a lot of money producing it. [Bryant Hodson](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-storyboard-experiences-fc051e2bc04d)

Create a simple storyboard (6 or 8 cells) for each of your personas. Illustrate how they might each interact with your guide. This could be an illustration of their touch points and interactions with your guide throughout the day, or perhaps during a term?

This will help the team think about how your users are going to use and interact with your guide.

by Rachel Krause ](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/storyboards-visualize-ideas/).

Rachel also has a video - [How to Create a UX Storyboard](https://youtu.be/bNh54LNUtv8).

### Instructions:

- Create your persona on paper or digitally depending on your skills. It does not have to be 'high fidelity'.
- The above article includes a template you can print, or shows how post-its can be used in a collaborative manner.
- Add captions to each frame.
- If on paper, scan rather than photograph for better results.
- Output each of your storyboards as .jpg or .png files
- Ensure the files are at least 1900px wide
- Save to the sp2-media folder
- Embed each storyboard image (using the code provided) in `storyboards.md`

## Information Architecture Report

Information Architecture Report - The team must carry out and record both an **Open Card Sort** and **Tree Testing** exercises to inform your initial site architecture. This will be illustrated as a site plan.

> Card sorting is a method used to help design or evaluate the information architecture of a site. In a card sorting session, participants organize topics into categories that make sense to them and they may also help you label these groups. [Usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html).

Undertake an Open Card Sort with a number of people using paper or [Optimal Workshop Card Sort](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort) (online).

Read [Card Sorting 101: Your guide to creating and running an effective card sort](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/101/card-sorting). Optimal Sort.

Once you have an architecture you like, test it out with a tree testing exercise, again on paper or using [Optimal Workshop Treejack](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack) (online) on a number of people.

Read [Tree Testing 101: Your guide to creating and running effective tree tests](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/101/tree-testing).

### Report

Write a short (800 words maximum) illustrated report on the process and results of both the card sort and tree testing exercises.
